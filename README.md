This repository is used as a base image to get ERPNext working. If you are interested in ERPNext running on Docker please take a look at the [ianneub/docker-erpnext](https://github.com/ianneub/docker-erpnext) repository.

The Docker image tag `latest` will always point to the most recent stable version of Frappe.
